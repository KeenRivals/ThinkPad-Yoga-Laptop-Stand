# ThinkPad Yoga Laptop Stand

This laptop stand allows you to get good airflow to the bottom of your ThinkPad Yoga laptop. It probably will work well with other laptops, but I can confirm it works with:

* ThinkPad Yoga S1
* ThinkPad Yoga 12
* ThinkPad Yoga 260
* ThinkPad Yoga 370

The model was built using OpenSCAD to extrude the SVG files to 3D blocks. The SVG files were designed in InkScape.

# Build Instructions

1. Print two "Yoga Stand Side.stl".
2. Print one "Yoga Stand Support.stl".
3. Fit the support into the sides in the middle.
